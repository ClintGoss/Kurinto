## Overview 

Kurinto is a large collection of free fonts that include most of the characters in every human language.
The collection is designed for authors who write primarily in a European language (i.e. using Latin letters),
but who also include text that uses other, non-European, writing systems.

While the fonts can be useful in many situations, they are specifically intended for authors who use word processors
(such as Microsoft Word) to publish multi-language text to digital documents (such as PDF).
Academic publishing is an ideal use of these fonts.
