# Kurinto Issues
This repository is for [filing and responding to issues](https://github.com/ClintGoss/Kurinto/issues) relating to the [Kurinto Font Folio project](https://Kurinto.com/).

I welcome suggestions, ideas, and reports of issues on the Kurinto fonts!
To maximize changes of getting a fix (and minimize my hassles) **please** include as much detail as possible,
including specific font names and locations, example documents, and screen captures of the issues.
I cannot guarantee any direct response, but my goal is to fix reported bugs in future releases.

Please visit www.Kurinto.com to access the fonts themselves.
